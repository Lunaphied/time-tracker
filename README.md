## Time Tracker

time-tracker is a simple application that does what it says, tracks a users time.

The primary goal for time-tracker is to simplify the needs of individuals who track their own time.
Some example usecases are:
* Consulting
* Project tracking
* Practice timing
or just about anything else that could be aided from recording a punch in and a punch out

That's all it does for the time being but there's plans for more production ready uses such as
* Small/home businesses
* A cost effective way of tracking people entering an event/area
and more, as long as it doesn't become too complex

Future plans include:
* Supporting windows builds
* Database support
* A web hosted version that would tie into databases
* Native Android app support (sorry no iOS, I don't have the hardware for development)
* Android wear tie-in for that app
* Tracking multiple users
* Authenticated tracking (using OTPs & logins to additionally authenticate users)
* API integrations for tracking by other events
* Configuration
* and more

Those are probably a while off, especially the fancier/non-personally helpful ones. But for now,
it does a good job at the original goal of single user tracking on Linux
